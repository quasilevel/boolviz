    <h5 class="subhead">1. AND Gate :</h5>
    <p class="para1">An AND gate is a logic gate having two or more inputs and a single output. An AND gate operates on
        logical
        multiplication rules. In this gate, if either of the inputs is low (0), then the output is also low. If all of
        the inputs are high (1), then the output will also be high. An AND gate can have any number of inputs, although
        2 input and 3 input AND gates are the most common. <br> There are two binary digits 0 and 1. We just told that
        an AND gate performs a binary multiplication of binary digits. In multiplying 0 with 0 we will get 0, 1 with 0
        or 0 with 1 we will get 0. Only we get 1 when 1 is multiplied by 1.
        In other words, an AND gate is a digital device that produces high output only when all inputs are high and
        produces low output under all other inputs conditions. A high digital signal means logically 1 and a low digital
        signal means logically 0.</p>
